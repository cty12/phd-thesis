In my PhD thesis, I plan to present the formal specifications and
the mechanized meta-theoretic results for a gradual security-typed
programming language called {{{surface}}} in the Agda proof assistant.
The language is /secure/, because the output of running a well-typed
{{{surface}}} program does not give out information about its input;
the language is /gradual/, because the programmer can choose between
enforcing security statically when the program type-checks, versus
dynamically when the program executes.
