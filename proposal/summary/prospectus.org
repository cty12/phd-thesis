In my PhD thesis, I plan to introduce the formal specifications and
present the mechanized meta-theoretic results for a gradual security-typed
programming language called {{{surface}}} in the Agda proof assistant.
The language is /secure/, because its type system and runtime together
ensure the information-flow policy that the output of running a well-typed
{{{surface}}} program does not give out information about its input.
The language is /gradual/, because it gives programmers the choice
between enforcing the aforementioned security policy statically,
when the program type-checks, versus dynamically, when the program
executes. Due to the sensitive nature of information-flow control,
there is strong desire to machine-check (mechanize) the proofs.
Agda is a proof assistant based on a variant of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory
(MLTT), which makes sure that all proofs are correct.

More formally, I keep two major properties in mind when designing
and reasoning about {{{surface}}}, namely /noninterference/ and
/the gradual guarantee/. They are meta-theoretic properties for
/security/ and /graduality/ respectively. In the setting of
functional programming, noninterference says that a potentially
malicious party cannot infer high-security user inputs by
observing the evaluation results for multiple executions
of the same program.
