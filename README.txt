Statements:
1. Gradual IFC languages should not include \unk as a security label
   on literals and values
2. Gradual IFC could be useful for the programmers
3. IFC languages should satisfy noninterference
4. NSU checking is a useful approach for enforcing noninterference (through the heap)
5. Gradual languages should provide type-based reasoning
  5.1 Gradual languages should be vigilant
  5.2 Gradual IFC languages should perform type-guided classification
6. Gradual languages should satisfy the gradual guarantee

Statements about Connections:
- LambdaIFCStar does not include \unk as a runtime security label

- LambdaIFCStar satisfies noninterference (*)
- LambdaIFCStar uses NSU to enforce noninterference through the heap
- LambdaIFCStar is both vigilant and performs type-guided classification
- LambdaIFCStar satisfies the gradual guarantee
- LambdaIFCStar is type safe
