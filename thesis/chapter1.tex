\section{Motivation}

With the development of digital society, people are increasingly
concerned about the confidentiality of their personal data and
the integrity of their online assets. Increasingly relying on
computing devices and the Internet in their daily life, people fear that
sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers,
medical records, bank account balances... may be revealed to malicious
third parties. People also worry that their digital photo albums,
signatures on online legal documents, spreadsheets in cloud storage...
may be tampered and manipulated by potential attackers.

Indeed, the fears are justified by recent news events.
In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit the world headlines,
where the data collected from 87 million social media users was misused
without their consent
~\parencite{cadwalladr2018facebook,kitchgaessner2017cambridge,gonzalez2019global,hinds2020wouldn}.
In the healthcare sector, from 2005 to 2019, 249.09 million individuals
were affected by data breaches that caused exposure of sensitive medical
data~\parencite{seh2020healthcare}. In respect of data integrity, researchers
have found ways to tamper the analytics APIs~\parencite{pfeffer2018tampering} and
the metadata (such as the numbers of likes, follows, and views)~\parencite{paquet2017can}
of major social media platforms. To deal with the security and privacy
challenges of the increasingly digitalized world, the European Union introduced
the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to reform and regulate
the collection and processing of personal data. However, studies show
that business entities experience challenges in complying with GDPR
or auditing for compliance~\parencite{smirnova2024understanding},
particularly small-to-medium enterprises~\parencite{sirur2018we,freitas2018gdpr,harting2021impacts}.

From a technical perspective, ensuring the security and privacy of
personal data typically involves tracking and checking
the flow of information.
Modern software applications often accept user input where
selected fields are sensitive, whose confidentiality is required
during both parsing and processing. To rule out information leaks,
neither the sensitive fields, nor any data that depends on those fields,
is allowed to be revealed to a low-privilege observer.
Consider a web application that receives three fields from its user:
1) first name 2) last name 3) social security number, the grammar of which
is defined in figure \ref{fig:grammar}, where terminals are divided into
low-security and high-security.
The digits $d$ for social security number, being confidential to users of
the web application, are of high-security, so they are marked {\color{red}
  red}, while other terminals, such as the keys of the record and the
strings $w$ for first name / last name, being safe to disclose, are
all of low-security, marked in {\color{green} green}.

Consider the following user input:

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none,xleftmargin=0.1\textwidth]
{FirstName=Mad;LastName=Hatter;SSN=012-34-5678}
\end{lstlisting}

The author of the web application could implement a parser for the
grammar in Figure \ref{fig:grammar} in a language that enforces
information flow security.  Each terminal in the grammar would be
labeled with a security level and the language would guarantee that
the high-security information is only present in those parts of the
output parse tree that are marked as high-security.  For example,
according to the grammar in figure \ref{fig:grammar}, the example user
input string is parsed into the parse tree in figure
\ref{fig:parsetree}, where the terminal nodes that represent digits of
the social security number are of {\color{red} high-security}, while
the terminals that compose the rest of the input string are of
{\color{green} low-security}.  The confidentiality of SSN is guaranteed
during data processing since the language enforces
noninterference. When the web application interacts with the outside
world, such as making a foreign function interface (\textit{FFI}) call
or storing into a database, the conceptual language need to encrypt
whatever values labeled as high security before they are passed into a
foreign routine.
