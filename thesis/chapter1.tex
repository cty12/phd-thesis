\section{Motivation}

With the development of digital society, people are increasingly
concerned about the confidentiality of their personal data and
the integrity of their online assets. People fear that their
social security numbers, medical records, bank account balances...
may be revealed to malicious third parties. People also worry
that their digital photo albums, signatures on online legal documents,
spreadsheets in cloud storage... may be tampered and manipulated
by potential attackers.
In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit the world headlines,
where the data collected from 87 million social media users was misused
without their consent.

Modern software applications often accept user input where
selected fields are sensitive, whose confidentiality is required
during both parsing and processing.
