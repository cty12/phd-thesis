Ensuring the security and privacy of personal data typically involves tracking
and checking the flow of information. Languages with gradual information-flow
control combine static and dynamic techniques to prevent security leaks. Gradual
languages should satisfy the gradual guarantee: programs that only differ in the
precision of their type annotations should behave the same modulo cast errors.
Unfortunately, Toro et al. [2018] identify a tension between the gradual
guarantee and information security. They conjecture that it is not possible to
enforce noninterference and satisfy the gradual guarantee.

In my PhD dissertation, I harmoniously combine static and dynamic enforcement of
information-flow control (IFC) in one programming language, \Surface. \Surface
satisfies both noninterference and the gradual guarantee at the same time
without making any sacrifices. \Surface (1) enforces information flow security,
(2) satisfies the gradual guarantee, (3) supports type-based reasoning, and (4)
requires no extra static analysis prior to program execution. The key to the
design of \Surface is to exclude the unknown label from runtime security labels.
On the technical side, the semantics of \Surface is the first gradual
information-flow control language to be specified using coercion calculi (a la
Henglein). Casts in \Surface are represented by security coercions, which
enforce the flow of information while satisfying the gradual guarantee.

I mechanize the proofs of type safety and the gradual guarantee for \Surface in
the Agda proof assistant. I prove noninterference for \Surface by simulating
\Surface with its dynamic extreme.

In summary, my thesis is that it is possible to design a gradual IFC programming
language that satisfies noninterference and the gradual guarantee while
supporting type-based reasoning, by excluding the unknown label from run-time
security labels and using security coercions to represent casts.
